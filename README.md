Attendance, Catering, and Access Control System
Overview
This project is a microservices-based system designed for a company with one floor, two rooms, a canteen, and a basement parking area. It provides three core functionalities:

Attendance: Tracks employee presence with face recognition, fingerprint, NFC, and QR code verification, including penalties/rewards, leave management, and Jira integration.
Catering Automation: Manages food reservations with QR code tokens, menu recommendations, inventory tracking, and sustainability incentives.
Access Control: Secures access to locations using face recognition (with low-light support placeholders), vehicle plate recognition, and emergency system integration.
The system is built using Docker, FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, and Redis, ensuring scalability, modularity, and GDPR compliance. It includes separate Administrative and User Panels with role-based access control (RBAC), multilingual support (English, Persian, Arabic), offline capabilities, and WCAG-compliant UI.

Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture, with the following services:

Attendance Service: Handles attendance recording, leave requests, shift management, and reporting (FastAPI, PostgreSQL).
Catering Service: Manages food reservations, menu recommendations, inventory, and sustainability tracking (FastAPI, PostgreSQL).
Access Control Service: Controls access with face recognition, vehicle tracking, and emergency integrations (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MQTT).
AI Engine Service: Provides fraud detection, demand prediction, and menu recommendations (FastAPI).
GraphQL Service: Aggregates data across services for unified queries and transparency reports (Ariadne).
Frontend Service: Provides role-based Administrative and User Panels (React, Tailwind CSS).
Mock Services: Simulate Jira and calendar APIs for integration testing.
Nginx: Reverse proxy for routing requests.
Redis: Caching and session management.
PostgreSQL: Centralized database for all services.
Features
Attendance:
Multi-factor authentication (face, fingerprint, NFC, QR).
Penalties/rewards for tardiness/punctuality.
Multi-stage leave approval (manager, HR).

Sustainability incentives for recyclable containers.
Comparative consumption analysis.
Access Control:
Face recognition with low-light/multi-person support (placeholders).
Vehicle plate recognition for parking.
Emergency system integration (fire alarms, headcount reports).
Meeting reservation integration (mock calendar API).
General:
Role-based Administrative and User Panels (manager, HR, employee).
Transparency reports for data usage.
Opt-out options for tracking (e.g., location).
Mock ERP/CRM/Jira integrations.
Energy optimization for access devices.
Multilingual (English, Persian, Arabic) and WCAG-compliant UI.
Offline support with IndexedDB syncing.
Voice command integration.
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose (version 3.8+).
Node.js (v16+) and npm for frontend development.
Python (3.10+) for backend services.
Postman (optional) for API testing.
VS Code (recommended) for development.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:
bash

Copy
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Dependencies:
Backend (each service):
bash

Copy
cd services/<service-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
Frontend:
bash

Copy
cd services/frontend
npm install
Configure Environment:
Update TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID in services/attendance/app/main.py for notifications.
Set SECRET_KEY in services/attendance/app/main.py for JWT authentication.
Ensure DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL in docker-compose.yml match your setup.
Run the System:
bash

Copy
docker-compose up --build
Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000.
Access GraphQL at http://localhost:8005.
Backend services run on ports 8001 (attendance), 8002 (catering), 8003 (access-control), 8004 (ai-engine).
Database Initialization:
The PostgreSQL database (attendance_db) is auto-created on startup.
Run migrations if needed:
bash

Copy
docker-compose exec <service> alembic upgrade head
Usage
Login:
Use the frontend login page (or Postman) to authenticate with username/password.
Obtain a JWT token stored in localStorage.
Administrative Panel (manager or hr roles):
Access at http://localhost:3000 after login.
Manage users, approve leaves, configure shifts, generate PDF/Excel reports, monitor access logs, and track sustainability.
User Panel (employee role):
Access at http://localhost:3000 after login.
Record attendance, reserve food, view schedules, and manage opt-out settings.
API Testing:
Use Postman to test endpoints:
Attendance: http://localhost:8001 (e.g., /attendance/, /leaves/approve/).
Catering: http://localhost:8002 (e.g., /reservations/, /tokens/pdf/{id}).
Access Control: http://localhost:8003 (e.g., /access-logs/, /emergency/fire-alarm/).
GraphQL queries: http://localhost:8005 (e.g., transparencyReport).
Hardware Integration (placeholders):
Replace face recognition placeholders (verify_face, verify_multi_person) with DeepFace or similar libraries.
Test with cameras supporting low-light conditions and multiple feeds.
Testing
Backend Tests:
bash

Copy
cd services/<service-name>
pytest
Tests cover user creation, attendance recording, leave approval, and more.
Frontend Tests (optional):
Add Jest/React Testing Library tests in services/frontend/src/__tests__.
Integration Tests:
Verify service communication via GraphQL queries and mock integrations (Jira, calendar).
Security
Authentication: JWT-based with AES-256 encryption for sensitive data.
GDPR Compliance: Transparency reports and opt-out options for tracking.
Network: Nginx reverse proxy and Docker network isolation.
Limitations
Hardware-Dependent Features: Face recognition (low-light, multi-person) and IoT integrations (e.g., fire alarms) use placeholders. Replace with actual libraries/devices in production.
Mock Integrations: Jira and calendar APIs are mocked. Replace with real endpoints for production.
Scalability: Add load balancing (e.g., Kubernetes) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus) for large-scale deployment.
Future Improvements
Implement a dedicated login page in the frontend.
Add refresh tokens for secure session management.
Extend with a mobile app using React Native.
Integrate real-time monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana.
Deploy with Kubernetes for scalability.
